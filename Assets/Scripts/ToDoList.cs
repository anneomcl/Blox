/* TO-DO list:

- Github
- Fix stackoverflow collisions (this will likely be fixed when recenter/resize are debugged)
- Partition the centers of blocks so that multiple children fit
- Make it so that you can choose which block to put block inside (choose the parent)
- Change order of children in parent's array depending on where the user places them

- Allow users to type input into the blocks (loop X times, print X statement)
- Translate the input + block type into code based on the tree hierarchy
- Execute the code and print the result on-screen

- Create a puzzle class with an image and a result
- Create code that gets a result, compare it to a puzzle class and print check or X for correctness

- Design puzzles
- Create UI
- Graphic Design for Blocks and UI?
